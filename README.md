# Gfetch_init
 This repo contains the most simple initial setup to start using the Gfetch.js module in a static website.
 
 I created this module with the desire to have a tool as simple as possible to be able to create an online site quickly and visually, with all the advantages of dynamic content management and the immediacy of an app like Google Docs (Gdocs in short), which we are all used to working with.
